# Link Opener Browser Extension

*Work in progress*

A simple extension, which exports all open tabs in the session to a `.txt` file and can open links from a `.txt` file.

Created because I have a lot of tabs. Also I always wondered how to create a browser extension and now I know.

### How-to
- Clone this repository
- Open `chrome://extensions/`
- Enable `Developer mode` (top right)
- Click `Load Unpacked`
- Voil√†, you can now use it

### To-dos
- Dark Mode
- Support different browsers
- Add a `.crx` file for easier installation
- Improve the styling
- Add support for tab groups
